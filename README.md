My Github account is new. I created it today. It will consist of repositories and its changes.
The repository I created consisted of me naming the repository by my usersname followed by github.io. This repository includes the changes I made during this assignment which included putting my name and email address, making a brief description of my Github account and the repository that I created, and a description of the steps that I took to clone this repository onto my local machine. 
The steps that I took to clone this repository was pretty simple. First, I clicked on "File" and clicked on "Clone Repository". From there I chose the repository that I wanted to clone. Then it asked me where I wanted to store it.
